# bikesharing

## Overview

In this project, we analyzed bike sharing data from Citi Bike in New York with the goal of gaining insights for our own bikeshare company. We gained valuable insights into the mechanics of the bikesharing operation, and we used Tableau to convert these insights into compelling vizualizations. 

## Results

The interactive Tableau vizualizations can be accessed through the following link:
